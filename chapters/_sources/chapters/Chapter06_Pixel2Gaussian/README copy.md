## :rocket:  :rocket:  :rocket: **News**
- [x]  **Arxiv Version has been released.**
- [x]  **Test code has been released.**
- [x]  **The pretrained model has been released.**
- [x]  Since this paper is completed within the company, the related code and pre-trained models cannot be released. To support the open-source community, we voluntarily and freely attempt to reproduce it in this repository. The reproduced results may have very slight deviations, but the difference stays within 0.05 dB.

## TODO
- [ ] Release train code.

##  üí° Summary
We introduce **ContinuousSR**, a novel Pixel-to-Gaussian paradigm designed for fast and high-quality arbitrary-scale super-resolution. By explicitly reconstructing 2D continuous HR signals from LR images using Gaussian Splatting, **ContinuousSR** significantly improves both efficiency and performance. Through statistical analysis, we uncover the Deep Gaussian Prior (DGP) and propose a DGP-driven Covariance Weighting mechanism along with an Adaptive Position Drifting strategy. These innovations improve the quality and fidelity of the reconstructed Gaussian fields. Experiments on seven popular benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and speed, achieving a {19.5√ó} speed improvement and {0.90dB} PSNR improvement, making it a promising solution for ASSR tasks.

## üí° Motivation and Framework
![method](assets/motivation.png)&nbsp;
Compared to other methods, the proposed ContinuousSR delivers significant improvements in SR quality across all scales, with an impressive 19.5√ó speedup when continuously upsampling an image across forty scales.

## Get Started
### Pretrained model
- After our thorough reproduction process, we are excited to **open-source** the pre-trained model!  
- The **best-performing version** of our method can be downloaded here:  ‚û°Ô∏è [Pretrained Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UKXch2ryl6zZWs9QCgtfWpgVwtYLsxtS/view?usp=drive_link)  
- Once downloaded, place the model in the designated folder, and you‚Äôll be ready to run the demo and perform inference. üöÄ  

### Demo
Here is an Demo
```bash
# scale represents the magnification factors for height and width respectively
python demo.py --input butterflyx4.png --model ContinuousSR.pth --scale 4,4 --output output.png
```
### Inference
Here is an example command for inference
```bash
# test Set5 X4
python test.py --config ./configs/test/test-set5-4.yaml --model ContinuousSR.pth
```
